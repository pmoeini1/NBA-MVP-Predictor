# NBA MVP Predictor
 
The NBA MVP award is an annual award given to the NBA's "Most Valuable Player". However there is no set criteria for this award, and voters are notorious for having inconsistent criteria and overvaluing team success.

The purpose of this project is to see which box score stats best correlate with receiving a high share of MVP votes, and then using that criteria year over year to see who would be MVP if the criteria were held consistently.
